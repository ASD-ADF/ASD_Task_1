## Exercises
A. Insert Sort (\*\*\*)
	write a procedure to receive a number in parameter and insert it into an array so that the array result is in ascending order<br>
	Example:<br>
	```cpp
	n=0;
	insert_sort(arr,n++,4);
	view_data_1(arr,n);
	// should print [4]
	
	insert_sort(arr,n++,2);
	insert_sort(arr,n++,5);
	view_data_1(arr,n);
	// should print [2, 4, 5]
	```
B. Insert Last Unique (\*\*)
	write a procedure to receive a number in parameter and insert it into an array so that no duplicate value exist in the array
C. Insert First (\*\*)
	write a procedure to receive a number in parameter and insert it into an array as the first element
D. Insert Last (\*)
	write a procedure to receive a number in parameter and insert it into an array as the last element
E. Search and Delete (\*\*\*)
	write a procedure to receive a number and delete all number found in the array
F. Remove Duplicates (\*\*\*)
	write a procedure to remove all duplicate number inside an array
G. Maximum and Minimum (\*)
	write a function to find the maximum and minimum number inside an array. Return the result as string
H. Count and Sum (\*)
	write a function to count the odd number inside an array and sum the even number. Return the result as string
I. Group Data (\*\*)
	write a function to group the numbers in array into odd-even group in a string
J. Swap Data (\*\*)
	write a procedure to swap all number inside an array front to end (1-2-3 into 3-2-1)
K1. View Data 1 (\*)
	write a procedure to view all number inside an array (front to end)
K2. View Data 2 (\*)
	write a procedure to view all number inside an array, but in backward (from behind to front)
